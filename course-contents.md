# Enter Technical Writer

## Introduction (Who am I?)

PICTURE TO THE LEFT
> Technical writers are trained to reveal almost nothing about themselves in their writing. This makes them freaks in the world of writers, since almost all of the other ink-stained wretches in that world reveal a lot about themselves to the reader.

### Learning objective

Get a glimpse of who technical writers are.

### Overview

To create documentation that is crisp and clear, technical writers must understand the user's world well enough to help them perform their tasks and resolve problems efficiently.

Plainly speaking, technical documentation is not about you, it’s about your readers’ needs, wants, tasks, and problems.

*Select a card to learn more.*

CARD 1: What's in a name?

A technical writer goes by many names. These are, to name just a few:

- Technical communicator
- Editor
- Information specialist
- Information developer
- User-assistance developer

The common denominator is the ability to create structured user-targeted knowledge based on inputs from subject-matter experts, own research, and first-hand experience.

CARD 2: Foundations

Explore the minimum expectations for a technical writer and see if you can be a good match:

- English proficiency (B2 or higher)
- Communication skills
- Investigative skills
- Basic IT knowledge
- Information analysis
- Lucid writing

CARD 3: Education and training

Technical writers often come from a variety of backgrounds, such as:

- English or another writing-intensive discipline
- Journalism or communications
- Computer Science or Information Technology
- Engineering or another technical field

Further education or certifications that are beneficial in this field include:

- Certificate in Technical Writing
- Master's in Technical Communication
- Certified Professional Technical Communicator (CPTC)

While these are not always needed, they help to cultivate specific skills and methodologies applied in technical writing.

CARD 4: Soft skills

A good technical writer also needs a set of soft skills, such as:

- Time management: to work on multiple tasks and meet deadlines
- Teamwork: to collaborate with subject experts, editors, and other team members
- Empathy: to understand the user's perspective
- Flexibility: to adapt to changes in products, projects, or writing tools.

These soft skills help a technical writer to be successful, adaptable, and user-focused in their work.

## What do I do?

PICTURE

Technical writers can engage in various activities, for example:

- *Information development*, including authoring software documentation and creating video tutorials and how-to videos.
- *Content services*, including assisting with documentation templates and keeping the documentation up to date.
- *Consultation and review*, including developing documentation solutions, evaluating the quality of technical documentation, improving documentation processes throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC), and developing project-specific and solution-specific style guides.

*Select each activity to see more details about it.*

EXPANDABLE BLOCKS

BLOCK 1. 
Information development

PICTURE

- *Create consistent user-centric UI experience through UI texts* ranging from UI microcopy to system messages to wizards to help users quickly familiarize themselves with the application and get started without referring to the documentation outside the product they are using.
- *Provide users with comprehensive help* to perform tasks and find solutions to problems, including online and in-app help.
- *Help users install and configure software*, especially when specific prerequisite steps are required, through administration, installation, and configuration guides.
- *Help users achieve specific goals* through training guides, how-tos, and tutorials, including video tutorials to walk users through specific usage scenarios.
- *Provide API-related information* to explain what users need to get an API up and running, including reference information about methods, parameters, and other relevant items.
- *Maintain a history of documentation effort* through release notes or changelog to keep track of changes, explaining what is new and listing fixed bugs and solved issues.
- *Author product descriptions* to serve as a single source of truth, for example, if Marketing needs to create pitches or explain to prospective clients how the product works, what features it has, and how these features can be used to achieve certain goals.
- *Enable unambiguous information exchange* through glossaries and consistent use of terms across the product.

BRIDGE: You will read about the documentation types in the Types of Technical Documentation module.

BLOCK 2. 
Content services

PICTURE

A technical writer can play a role of a content manager, for example:

- *Create, maintain, and optimize a documentation repository.*
For example, the repository may be in SharePoint, with a plan to make sure that all documents remain up to date. In this scenario, the technical writer tags some documents for revision at specific intervals, initiates the review of the documents when some changes occur as part of the release cycle, archives or deletes obsolete or irrelevant documents, and cooperates with the subject-matter experts and document owners as needed.
- *Migrate content across content management systems (CMS).* In this case, technical writers play more of a publisher role, helping the migration team to move the existing content into a new CMS. That may sound easy, but in fact such tasks might be quite challenging, given the volume of work, the absence of any one-to-one mapping between the legacy content and new content templates, the need to understand which of the content is outdated, where to update the visuals, and how to track changes and quickly respond to change requests, and so on.
- *Investigate specific tools to support documentation needs.* Technical writers may be called in to investigate multiple content management systems to understand which of them ideally fits the bill for the customer. Alternatively, technical writers may implement single-source solutions to deliver easily maintainable documentation in a variety of media: for web or print, for different users, or different locales.
- *Develop style guides to ensure consistency of documentation by setting up the process continuity.* Custom style guides set the common tone of voice, while offering the added benefit of having documentation that is easy to consume. Such documentation utilizes a consistent layout and shares the navigation principles.

BLOCK 3. 
Consultation and review

Technical writers can share their expertise, for example:

- Act as linguistic experts in *evaluating the quality of the technical information*, that is assess if the document meets the criteria of being easy to use, easy to understand, and easy to find. For example, they can say if the documentation relies on the appropriate set of word choices wrapped into correct grammar and style. They can also see if the documentation consistently uses the same structure (for ease of reference and search), the same terms (to ensure that the text is unambiguous and relies on the wordings accepted by the industry), and generally has enough clarity to be understood even by people with limited proficiency in English.
- *Verify that documentation processes are followed through*, and the documents created are accessible, actionable, and generally up-to-date.
- *Identify the scope of documentation* that might be needed for the project. For example, user guides to help users accomplish their tasks, admin guides to help set up and maintain the system properly, and how-to manuals and video tutorials to ensure smooth knowledge transfer to new team members.
- *Support the team* by carefully monitoring the development of the product and creating release notes with each new release, revising and updating existing guides, and generally supporting other documentation needs.

## Case studies

### Technical writer on a Scrum project

As a member of the development team, a technical writer:

- *Embraces Agile learning:* Continuously learns about the product, knowing both the 'as-is' and 'to-be' states of the product and leveraging this knowledge 'to stay ahead of the plane'—technical writers not merely respond to change, they see the change coming and have their initial drafts ready before the change is released.
- *Participates in Scrum ceremonies:* Joins daily standups, sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives. In this way, the technical writer stays informed and informs the others, as well as engages in and contributes to discussions on the user workflows and, overall, user experience, often serving as a proxy for the user and, as such, enabling a positive impact on the product.
- *Develops user-centric information:* Creates factually correct, complete, and consistent information where and when the user needs it, in the most appropriate format. Information so created is aligned with the user needs and enhances the usability and utility of the product.
- *Iterates on content creation:* Continuously refines and updates information based on feedback and product evolution throughout the sprint cycles.
- *Uses Agile tools:* Employs XML- and topic-based authoring tools for creating reusable and easily modifiable content chunks, staying ready for rapid changes that may need to be deployed in multiple formats, across a variety of platforms, and for multiple audiences.
- *Facilitates information architecture:* Helps structure and organize information so that it is easy to use, easy to understand, and easy to navigate. This includes clear navigation pathways, content categorization and organization, effective labeling, and documentation life cycle.

### Technical writer and Generative AI

By forming a synergetic relationship with GenAI, a technical writer:

- *Draws on the massive body of knowledge for research:* Digs deep into information made available thanks to GenAI to contextualize knowledge in the best ways possible.
- *Leverages GenAI for initial drafts and routine tasks:* Uses GenAI for initial drafts and routine tasks, being able to shift the focus to complex documentation aspects. GenAI accelerates content creation, helping writers keep pace with the rapid product development cycles.
- *Enhances content quality:* Integrates GenAI's advanced language models to improve the clarity, coherence, and engagement of technical documents. This results in higher-quality content that is easier for users to understand and apply.
- *Streamlines review processes:* Utilizes GenAI's capabilities to automate the review of technical content, identifying inconsistencies or areas that require clarification, thus speeding up the editing cycle.
- *Facilitates multilingual documentation:* Employs GenAI to assist with the translation and localization of documents, ensuring that content is accessible to a global audience without compromising on technical accuracy.
- *Supports creative problem-solving:* Leverages the creative output of GenAI to propose innovative solutions for complex documentation challenges, such as visualizing abstract concepts or creating interactive user guides.
- *Adapts to user feedback:* Uses GenAI to analyze user feedback and incorporate it into documentation, continuously improving the relevance and usefulness of the content.

A word of caution. While GenAI is a powerful tool that can augment the technical writer's capabilities, it is essential to approach its output with a critical eye. The technical writer must ensure the accuracy and relevance of the information, as GenAI may not always discern the nuances of context or the latest industry developments. It is the writer's responsibility to validate the content, ensuring it adheres to the highest standards of veracity, completeness, and ethical practice.

### Technical writer and API documentation

As part of the API development team, a technical writer:

- *Gathers technical information:* Explores available API documentation, and asks developers questions to clarify points related to API's structure, functionality, and use cases.
- *Produces developer-focused content:* Creates precise, clear, and comprehensive documentation following the best practices for API documentation and technical communication. This includes quick start guides, endpoint descriptions, request and response examples, and troubleshooting sections, all designed to provide a seamless developer experience.
- *Organizes information logically:* Structures API documentation in a way that is intuitive for developers to follow, with a clear hierarchy, logical flow, and effective search functionality, making the information easy to find and understand.
- *Iterates with the product:* Adapts documentation in sync with the API's evolution, to ensure that developers always have access to the latest information. Collects and integrates developer feedback to continuously improve and enhance the quality and usefulness of the API.
- *Uses documentation tools:* Relies on specialized tools for API documentation, such as Swagger or Postman, to create interactive, user-friendly content that can be easily updated and maintained.
- *Ensures consistency across documentation:* Maintains a uniform style, terminology, and formatting across all documentation for uniformity.
- *Develops versioning strategies:* Establishes clear documentation versioning practices to manage changes and maintain historical accuracy for API versions.
- *Adopts documentation-as-code practices:* Integrates documentation into the software development lifecycle by treating it as part of the codebase. This approach allows for version control, continuous integration, and automated testing of documentation, ensuring it evolves alongside the API and maintains the highest quality standards.
- *Maintains release notes:* Announces new, changed, or deprecated features on the day of their launch.

# Research and Adapt

## Introduction

> The box was really solid. (...) (When everything was ready) I asked (my uncle) why he was carrying a whole box behind the house, when he needed one screwdriver. - Yes, Steve - he replied (...) - but I didn't know what else I will find here, right? It's best to have all the tools always with you. Otherwise, you will surely come across something that you are not prepared for, and that may only put you off.

### Learning objective

Find out what fields technical writers can work in.

### Overview

Technical writers act on assignment, like carpenters or other skilled workers. All people of trade must understand which tools fit best in each situation, and how they must apply those to achieve the best results. The ability to make the right choices draws on experience and expertise, creative thinking and adaptability, and eventually comes down to being always ready to learn new things, being ready for the unknown.

As technical writers are getting started, their primary task, regardless of the domain, is to learn as much as possible—much more in fact than they will ever need to put into the information they create. They learn from subject-matter experts (SMEs) to become SMEs themselves. Therefore, research and adaptability are integral qualities of any technical writer, whether it's a seasoned technical communication pro with a solid track record in authoring, or a novice just embarking on their first project ever.

The following illustration gives an overview of the business domains the EPAM technical writers work in.

PICTURES

Keep in mind that projects within the same area can differ significantly, and staying in the same sphere may still require technical writers to adapt.

SEQUENCE BAR WITH PICTURES

### Self-organize and communicate

Technical writers often work alone but depend on the inputs from the other team members, such as product owners, UX designers, developers, business analysts, or QA engineers. Therefore, you must manage your time and workload to juggle your tasks and have excellent communication skills to collect the necessary information.

### Research

If a project relies on a technology you know little or nothing about, you need to do the research, especially when no dedicated training exists. Extensive research before the actual writing is crucial to the success of your writing. Sometimes, you need to put on your detective's hat and try to find all the evidence to crack the case. Sources for research are many:

- Reading documentation (whitepapers, initial guides, technical documentation, blueprints, and other types).
- Asking questions and holding interviews.
- Drafting a picture of the user personas.
- Surfing the internet for clues.
- Getting first-hand experience with whatever the object of your documentation is.
- Observing users: In some cases, seeing users interact with the product can shed light on their behavior, strengths, and difficulties, which can in turn shape the structure and content of the documentation.

### Know your audience

Knowing your audience will help you to:

- Identify and focus on the user needs, goals, and tasks.
- Understand how they prefer to consume information: whether it should be on the website, in downloadable files, or in printed one-pagers.
- Learn more about their domain, and thus use domain-specific terms or create documentation flows that users are accustomed to.
- Choose the appropriate level of detail.

Therefore, the earlier you can identify your target audience, the better.

A good place to start is to talk to the product owner or business analysts—they can have the sought-after information, because they may have already conducted user screening and research.

💡 Consider creating user personas—fictional characters created to represent different user types. User personas may help you understand your users' needs, experiences, behaviors, and goals, which can guide your writing style, format, and approach.

A typical user persona would include characteristics such as name, demographics, background, technical expertise, goals, needs, frustrations, and context of use. 

Example of a user persona for a software configuration and installation guide.

- Name: Tracy Jones.
- Demographics: Tracy is a 32-year-old software engineer living in a metropolitan area.
- Background: She has over five years of experience in her field and holds a degree in computer science. She specializes in back-end development and is proficient in various programming languages.
- Technical expertise: Tracy is tech-savvy. She can easily navigate complex software applications and technical documents. However, she's often in a hurry and appreciates clear, succinct documentation.
- Goals: Tracy often uses technical documentation to quickly solve specific issues she encounters while coding or to understand new APIs or libraries she should use in her work.
- Needs: She needs accurate, in-depth, and up-to-date technical documentation that gives clear and complete instructions and explanations in a language that relies on standardized terminology.
- Frustrations: Tracy gets annoyed when documentation is outdated and hard to navigate, or lacks real examples.
- Context of use: Tracy often refers to documentation on her dual screen at work while actively writing or debugging code.


### Cooperate and coordinate

When any project documentation exists, be it written by developers or specialists unrelated to technical communication, then a technical writer steps in to do the following:

- Rework and restructure the content to meet the requirements of the target audience.
- Optimize technical content for the final version.
- Create various documents based on the technical inputs from developers and engineers.

Some books written by professionals in the field are unavailable to the broader audience—they are read and understood only by other professionals in the same field. Luckily, there are specialists who can explain every mystery in a clear way, but there's not enough of them to explain everything to everyone—that's when technical writers come into play. They provide a fresh look and, having a more generic viewpoint, make all highly technical lingo clear, readable, and understandable for the target audience.

Technical writers explore user perspectives, and then tailor the acquired information to the needs of the respective audience. In many cases, they act as software and product QA engineers, albeit not from the technical, but from the organizational point of view. Furthermore, to create the best document possible, technical writers need to work closely with other project specialists.

## Conclusion

A technical writer must always focus on the target audience's needs and goals when creating information. Clarity, readability, and usefulness are therefore the primary measures of success.

BRIDGE: In the next module, you will learn what types of documents technical writers can create.

## Quiz

1. A user persona is ...

[] ... someone who helps the technical writer create full-fledged documentation.
[x] ... a fictional person who provides the technical writer with a good example of an actual person who might be using the information developed, complete with needs, wants, age, demographics, personal profile, and specific context of use.
[] ... a fictional person that only UX designers bother to create. Technical writers just need to reuse one for their purposes.

2. Choose one or more options.

[] Technical writers are there to sift through books in an attempt to put together something more readable and beneficial for the ultimate user.
[] Technical writers normally work alone, without soliciting information from their fellow workers. All they need can be found in written sources of information, such as Jira tickets, knowledge base articles, as well as by observing actual users.
[x] Technical writers always do research, even if they feel they are absolutely confident in the domain.
[x] Technical writers always need to keep the user in mind. That's how they can create information that is clear, complete, and understandable to the user.

### Learning objective

Learn about the most common types of documentation a technical writer works with.

### Overview

There are many types of technical documentation, each with a different target audience, scope, and purpose, such as:

- User guides
- Quick-start guides
- Installation manuals
- Configuration guides
- Operator manuals
- Administrator guides
- Reference manuals
- Developer documentation
- Online help
- Release notes
- API documentation
- White papers
- Newsletters
- UI texts
- Troubleshooting documentation

BRIDGE: Let's have a look at these types of documentation in detail.

## Types of technical documentation

The general rule for creating quality documentation is to know who you are writing for and why you are doing that. Once you identify the audience and the purpose, you will be able to determine many related things: the content and required level of technical detail, the terminology to ensure consistent and understandable user experience, the overall structure and layout to promote information scannability and navigability, and the channel best suited to deliver the information.

Let's find out more about each type of documentation and learn how to organize and structure information.

EXPANDABLE BLOCKS.

- User guides

User guides provide instructions for setting up and operating a product or software. They can contain a product overview, safety precautions, how-tos, hints and tips, FAQs, and troubleshooting information. It's also useful to include a glossary to define any technical or product-specific terms.

- Quick-start guides

Quick-start guides provide short instructions that emphasize the most important and useful procedures and features to help users quickly start using a product or software. These documents are usually one or two pages long and contain the most important procedures. They can be either printed and shipped with the product or made available digitally for users, often in a downloadable format. Visuals are highly recommended for this type of documents (a picture is worth a thousand words).

See also [Visual Aids and Styles](#visual-aids-and-styles)

- Installation manuals

Installation manuals guide users through the installation of an appliance, software, or hardware. These documents provide comprehensive information to help users understand system or product requirements and installation procedures. Hardware installation manuals typically start with safety instructions and a list of necessary tools or accessories. All installation manuals provide step-by-step procedures, accompanied by diagrams, photos, or screenshots. The steps must be followed in a specific order, and the procedure described normally addresses any choices or possible complications. Optionally, installation manuals may include troubleshooting, tips for optimal performance, maintenance instructions, and contact information.

- Configuration guides

Configuration guides inform users how to properly set up, configure, and operate an appliance, software, or hardware. These documents often contain encryption and password settings, backup settings, deployment configuration settings, network connection requirements, security assumptions, required permissions, best practices, and the preferable level of system protection.

- Operator manuals

Operator manuals provide essential instructions about product functionality, operating steps, and safety warnings. They are written for skilled operators in various fields, such as manufacturing, construction, computer, and are often published in a format that allows operators to use them at work.

- Administrator guides

Administrator guides explain how to administer an application or system. The documents can also provide instructions about installing, deploying, and configuring the software.

- Reference manuals

Reference manuals explain parts of a product. They may contain:

  - Background information about the subject.
  - Essential theory.
  - Full information about the product.
  - Explanation of the user interface elements such as dialog boxes, screens, fields, tabs, and buttons.
  - Explanation of options available for the user.

- Developer documentation

Developer documentation provides back-end and other software developer information. The document can contain a quick-start guide, code overview, build instructions, development process overview, developer how-tos (manage profile, run app, debug, customize app), and any kind of information a developer might need.
  
- Online help

Online help is a web documentation format that provides assistance to users. It is easy to navigate and contains a search engine to help users find the required information. Aside from the main information, online help also contains:

  - A home page
  - Table of contents
  - Search
  - Index and glossary

- Release notes

Release notes provide a regular report of changes or enhancements implemented with each software release, like new features, procedural changes, new safety requirements, and more. This document can also contain information about test procedures and test results. When the software is in development, the main audience of the document is developers. After the software is released, the target audience is customers, and they receive this document with each software update.

- API documentation

API documentation provides API functionality descriptions, tutorials, and examples for developers. Working on such documentation requires high-level understanding of the API functionality and requirements. API documentation usually contains:

  - API overview and concepts.
  - Summary of the API functionality.
  - Getting started section.
  - Authentication information.
  - Description of different API parts and how they interact.
  - Use cases with sample requests and responses.
  - Explanation of response parameters.
  - Information about possible errors.
  - Links to additional documentation.

- White papers

White papers can announce a new product, a new technical feature, or a business solution to a common problem. This document is an educational and marketing tool and establishes the company's market position. White papers can be distributed to customers and are often posted on corporate websites or websites that gather such documents from various sources. Technical writers working on a white paper must focus on demonstrating how the new product or feature can help users.

- Newsletters

Corporate newsletters inform users and create and sustain interest in an organization. Subscription newsletters encourage recipients to buy specific products or services. The content depends on the purpose of the document and the goals of the audience. It's best if newsletters are concise, engaging, and regularly delivered. They should be visually appealing and the content should be segregated in a way that it becomes easy for readers to quickly navigate to sections of their interest.

- UI texts

A technical writer can work together with UI designers and create UI messages and tooltips, as well as name UI elements, such as buttons, columns, fields, filters, and other UI elements.

- Troubleshooting documentation

Troubleshooting documentation provides clear descriptions of common problems with solutions that can be easily followed by the user. The purpose of this document is to minimize the amount of support requests by providing easy-to-implement solutions. The document usually contains:

  - The background information about the problem.
  - A step-by-step instruction to solve it.
  - Contact information and working hours for customer support.

If the problem persists or is too complicated, the troubleshooting document recommends contacting the support team.

## Conclusion

Creating technical documentation implies understanding who you are writing for and why—knowing the answers helps you decide what documentation is required and what it should contain.

# Creating Text

## Introduction

> All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.
>
> Ernest Hemingway

### Learning objective

Learn about the key stages of creating text and what lies underneath each stage.

### Overview

Writing is like an iceberg: 10% of what you see sits atop the other 90% represented by multiple hours of research, chasing and interviewing subject-matter experts, adding input from other team members, jotting down your own user experience, and then going through multiple edit loops. Your ability to obtain information and then convert it into actionable knowledge is critical for your success as a technical writer.

Text is the core of technical documentation, making writing the primary skill for any technical writer. Therefore, it is essential to know how to organize the writing process effectively.

Writing can be split into six stages:

1. Gathering the required information by any means and via any media at your disposal.
2. Choosing tools for creating your documentation.
3. Selecting the suitable style. At EPAM, technical writers follow the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide standards](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/), unless specified otherwise by the customer.
4. Planning the structure of your document.
5. Creating the first draft, polishing it, and sending it to your reviewer, if any.
6. Reviewing, updating, and publishing the document.

PICTURE

BRIDGE: Let's take a closer look at these stages.

## Step 1: Gather information

> For all that is secret will eventually be brought into the open, and everything that is concealed will be brought to light and made known to all.
>
> Luke 8:17, New Testament

PICTURE.

The key difference between a fiction writer and a technical writer is that the latter never relies on imagination and is always limited to using precise and detailed information to create texts. For technical writers, only facts and thorough descriptions count.

Before you can start gathering the necessary information, prepare yourself:

- *Establish lines of communication.*
Choose the preferable methods of acquiring information: face-to-face or online meetings, email, Microsoft Teams or other messaging software, or Jira issues. Pick and mix whatever works for you.

- *Get to know your team and subject-matter experts.*
Know whom to contact when you require a particular piece of information, especially if you need it ASAP.

- *Set priorities.*
Ask which features should be described first and devise a writing plan if necessary.

To gather the information:

- *Read.*
Developer notes, process descriptions, business requirements, product requirements, user stories, Jira issues, runbooks, wikis, web documentation, diagrams, email threads, white papers, questionnaires, or surveys—all qualify here.
The downside is that you often have to go through many lengthy texts to find the information you need, and you might still need guidance on what to include or omit.

In some cases, you have to transform videos into textual content. Additionally, tutorials provide essential information without going too deep into detail, and, therefore, can be quite useful. However, this method is rarely available for software in the prototyping phase or software that only exists as UI mockups.

- *Interview subject-matter experts.*
💡 For a successful interview, identify people you need to talk with, prepare your questions, and take notes during the interview or record it, provided you have obtained permission. If you need clarification, ask immediately. Right after the meeting, open and review your notes, or rewatch the recording. If you missed something, gather your questions and send them via email, or set up a follow-up interview until you run out of things to ask. The downside is that it may be problematic to set up a meeting—experts usually have packed schedules.

- *Participate in daily meet-ups and team syncs.*
Joining such events can keep you up to date with the current product or software development status. Besides, you can actively participate and give advice when you see room for improvement.

- *Check the UI mockups.*
UI mockups are an excellent way to visualize feature development, starting from ideation and sketches to a finalized set of mockups ready for implementation.

- *Get hands-on experience.*
Test the feature yourself, write down your experience, and then run it by someone directly involved in or related to the feature development to make sure you haven't missed anything important.

- *Attend corporate workshops.*
Some companies and customers organize thorough training sessions for new employees. At these workshops, they explain the product in detail. In some cases, such workshops can be part of the onboarding process and are mandatory; in other cases, you can choose to take or skip them, especially if you have experience with the corporate products.

- *Be inquisitive.*
Ask all the questions that you have, no matter how simple or silly they may seem to you—it's better to clarify everything in advance than correct it on the go or miss an important piece of information. The more questions you ask, the fewer follow-up sessions will be needed, thus saving time both for the subject-matter experts and you.

## Step 2: Choose the right tool

After gathering the information and figuring out the required documentation output formats, you need to choose a tool to complete your work.

💡 The customer may already have the content management infrastructure in place alongside extensive supporting documentation, so all you can do there is be a good sport and learn quickly to make good use of the existing tools. That said, here we'll be considering a situation where you have to build the required toolset from the ground up.

The choice of tools depends on many factors, including:

- Document types that you need to create.
- Tool price and license availability.
- Target audience. That is, whether your documentation should be available to any user or restricted to a certain user group.
- Output formats.
- Your experience with different tools.

Just to give a few examples:

- For internal compliance documents, use Microsoft Word and SharePoint.
- For HTML help and PDF documents from a single source, consider Adobe FrameMaker, Help+Manual, or MadCap Flare.
- For a knowledge base or internal developer documentation, explore content management systems, such as Confluence that has many integration options.
- For API documentation, choose tools specifically designed to maintain this documentation, such as Swagger, DreamFactory, or Redoc.
- For online help or a documentation site, consider using [static site generators (SSGs)](https://kb.epam.com/display/ETCCC/Static+Site+Generators), for example Docusaurus or MkDocs Material.

To learn more about technical writing tools, see [Tools and technologies](https://kb.epam.com/display/ETCCC/Tools+and+technologies).

BRIDGE: After you've selected the tool, you can start planning your documentation.

## Step 3: Choose a proper style

> Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
>
> Leonardo da Vinci

PICTURE.

You may have noticed that the previous two stages, albeit important, only deal with preparation. But the third stage has a direct strategic impact on creating text.

Choosing a style is extremely important, as it lays the foundation for the entire documentation library for months, and sometimes years, to come. And, unlike regular writers, technical writers have no privilege of writing in long and lexically rich sentences—on the contrary, technical documentation must be straightforward, concise, and devoid of any personal traits and hallmarks. Remember: the sole purpose of technical documentation is to inform and help, not to entertain or show off.

To ensure that all documentation is unified, clear, and concrete, you can rely on standards for creating documentation, or style guides. Overall, there are numerous style guides for different industries, tech is no exception.

Overall, follow these recommendations:

- *Select one style guide.*

Follow its recommendations to create documentation that is consistent in its look, language, and messaging, and is easy to maintain.

💡 **Remember**

-- Avoid combining several guides into a single "perfect" one. Unless you want Frankenstein's creature of a text.

-- Don't treat a single style guide as a solution to any issue—use your common sense or consult your colleagues.

-- Use style guides specific to the language of your documentation.

-- If customers have their own corporate style guides, study them carefully before typing your first sentence.

- *Consider the need for a project glossary and list of specific abbreviations.*

The glossary that you create in the beginning together with the list of specific abbreviations, when any, enables better understanding and improves consistency.

- *Ask stakeholders what practices they prefer.*

Anything not covered by a style guide—naming conventions, fonts and styles, colors, and other factors—is up to the technical writer. However, we advise to ask project management and stakeholders for approval to avoid misunderstanding, and to check for branding guidelines.

Almost any significant software company that has a large documentation library relies on a particular style guide (either internal or external).

To mention just a few:

- [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/) (the de facto EPAM standard for internal documentation).
- [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style).
- [Apple Style Guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/applestyleguide/welcome/web).
- [IBM Style Guide](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ibm-style-guide/9780132118989/) (book version).
- [Red Hat Style Guide](https://redhat-documentation.github.io/supplementary-style-guide/).

These guides contain key rules for grammar, word choice, punctuation, and text formatting. Following these rules is essential to keeping your documentation user-friendly and comprehensible.

Regardless of the style that you choose or have to follow, here are several tips:

- Know who you are writing for. As you write, keep asking yourself: will your target audience understand your documentation?
- Be truthful. Do not mislead your reader with any unverified information.
- Write naturally. People have no patience for something bombastic. They have a task to perform, or a problem to solve. Rarely do they read something technical for pleasure.
- Keep it simple and short. Say as much as you need to, and not more.
- Use active voice. Do not hide the doer.
- Be positive. Positive structures are easier to understand than sentences laced with negatives.
- Be definite, specific, and concrete.
- Avoid meaningless words. If a word does not add any value to the meaning, cut it out.
- Use parallelism. Repeat the same grammatical form in units of writing that serve the same purpose or share the same level of importance. For an example, look at how this list is structured.
- Revise and rewrite.

## Step 4: Plan your document

> A man who does not plan long ahead will find trouble at his door.
>
> Confucius

PICTURE.

After choosing the tools and the style guide, you can start planning your document. At this stage, you plan the structure, choose the number of sections and subsections, and predict the information each section needs to contain. Remember to consider any cultural, regional, or industry-specific requirements or standards that may impact the structure and content of your document.

### Manage your time

When your project leadership requests you to create a document, they either give you a deadline, or you should set a deadline. It is a good thing to increase your time estimations by 20-30% to cover any unforeseen risks, such as SME unavailability, information processing, and additional reviews. Of course, the requestors may not provide you the time you asked for, but it is a completely different story—it is up to you to convince them.

The same applies when requestors set impossible deadlines: you need to provide them with grounds to support your position—in that case, knowing average time estimations is a very good thing as it will help you avoid overkill.

Keep in mind, however, that time estimations apply only to standard situations, and don't cover errors or inconsistencies found in documentation.

To learn more about time estimations, see [Time estimations and metrics](https://kb.epam.com/display/ETCCC/Time+estimations+and+metrics) and [A three-point estimating technique (PERT)](https://projectmanagementacademy.net/resources/blog/a-three-point-estimating-technique-pert/).

### Structure the document

The structure depends on the document type, but generally any document includes the following parts:

- The introductory part that familiarizes users with a product or software.
- The starting section that helps users set up the product to better suit their needs and improve their experience.
- The main section, the contents of which depend on the document type. For example:
  - For guides, it is the description of various procedures.
  - For descriptions, it is⁠ the product details.
  - For API documentation⁠, it is various requests, code samples, and other technical information.
- The support section that contains the FAQ and other additional information.

Moreover, your document may contain a reference section with key notions, additional descriptions, and an index.

In general, the choice of structure depends on the document type and target audience, as covered by the previous module.

### Organize the content

Organize the content effectively, following these recommendations:

- Keep the content scannable, concise, easy to understand, and consistent.
- Outline the structure, layout, and design. See if you need the assistance of a UX designer.
- Define requirements for visuals, such as resolution, font size in images, and the need for captions.

### Use templates

One of the best ways to ensure consistency across documentation is using templates. Various content creation tools have a template library, for example, Microsoft Word. You can rely on the provided templates, or, if you can't find anything suitable, create a template of your own.

Using templates is efficient when:

- A customer has a brand book and requests to employ a particular visual style across documentation.
- You have a team of technical writers and need to minimize discrepancy.
- You have a lot of different page layouts and styles, and don't want to waste time on editing each new page.
- Content creation specialists rotate or hop on and off frequently, and you need to save time on onboarding.

Documentation based on templates has one significant advantage—your target audience quickly learns where they can find a particular piece of information on a page, and thus saves time on scanning and searching.

BRIDGE: After you have planned the document structure, get down to writing.

## Step 5: Create the first draft

>
> John Dufresne

PICTURE.

You can't expect (or be expected) to create an excellent document right off the bat even if you're extremely experienced in writing and using the tools, and know the product inside out. The reason is simple: when faced with a documentation task, you are inevitably doing something new to address a specific user need or problem. Therefore, your first draft is just your first attempt at penning your thoughts, inputs from other people, and information gathered elsewhere in whatever order or lexicon they come. You can, or even should, focus on polishing it up later.

When you begin writing:

1. Start with an introductory sentence that informs users what they can do or accomplish after reading the page.
2. If you are describing a step in a long flow, add prerequisites that must be fulfilled before a user can perform the described action.
3. If you think the user is unfamiliar with the product of software, then walk the user through the entire process from the main menu to the specific location where they need to perform the action (the "every page is page one" approach).
4. Supply your document with screenshots and other additional content that may help the user.
5. Add tips and warnings to steer the user away from wrong paths.
6. Finish your page with a resulting sentence.
7. Repeat the same for other pages.

To improve your draft page, follow these recommendations:

- Avoid adding too much information to a page. Remember the rule "one page—one action". For printable documents, you can use subheadings to arrange web pages into logical sections.
💡If you can create a folder using 10 different methods, do you need to list all of them? In most cases, the answer is no—describe the method that gets the user there the quickest.

- Try to fit procedures into seven or fewer steps. Otherwise, consider splitting the page into subpages or use on-page headings.
- Use screenshots wisely. For details, see [Screenshots in documentation—approaches, practices, and tips](https://kb.epam.com/x/oDZuZQ).
- Add links to other pages in your document or to other documents that users can read to learn more about the product.

💡 It is a good idea to leave the draft for a day or two, and then review it—you'll notice a lot of points for improvement with a fresh perspective.

When you consider the draft ready, send it for review and publishing.

BRIDGE: You'll read more about useful writing practices in the next module.

## Step 6: Review and publish

>
> Bill Gates

PICTURE.

### Revise thoroughly

Revision is the final stage before a document is released to the target audience. It’s good to bear in mind that different reviewers may have different focuses. Some may rigorously check for technical accuracy, others for grammar and style. Ideally, your document should be reviewed by someone proficient in each of these areas.

A standard review process looks like this:

1. You create and polish your draft.
2. You send the draft document to your stakeholder for review.
3. The reviewer looks through the document, and then either approves the document or provides comments and returns the document for correcting.
  - If the review is unsuccessful, you must correct the document and then repeat step 2. This is called a review or edit loop, and this may happen multiple times.
  - If the review is successful, you may publish the document and pick a new task.

### Test-drive your documents

No matter how many people reviewed your documentation, the ultimate trial is the user. Therefore, asking someone to walk the user path is an excellent test for your instructions or descriptions. In the absence of other readers or reviewers, test-drive the instructions yourself at least once to ensure that the procedure can be followed to the desired outcome.

If your test user can fulfill their task or find the required information, then your documents are successful, and you deserve a cookie!

### Reuse and recycle

Any documentation requires updating together with the related product. Depending on the amount of changes, updates may be a laborious process, sometimes requiring more time than a regular new topic. Apart from checking and rechecking new content, you have to understand which parts of the published documents must be updated or even removed (for example, as obsolete). Also, you have to think about all existing dependencies in other parts of the documentation.

To save time on updates, you can do the following:

- Describe features without excess details. Include as much information as users need to accomplish their tasks, and not more.
**Remember**
No one, not even technical writers, reads technical documentation for pleasure. All your users are too much distracted (or even outright stressed) by whatever problems they are experiencing to have patience to wade through excessive text.
- Reuse content when possible, which means that if you update a certain text fragment, then all documents with that source text fragment are updated automatically.
NOTE BOX This functionality may be unavailable in the tools that you use—check the tool features to find out.
- Use labels or other tags to optimize search—this way you can quickly find information related to a particular feature that requires updating. This is useful especially if you have a large documentation library.

### Pain points and painkillers
It is impossible to mention all issues that may occur during review, so this module concentrates on the most common ones.

SEQUENCE BAR.

#### Grammar

When creating textual content, focus on delivering the right information using the right grammar and right style. Remember that technical reviewers are more interested in the information itself and may have little to no time or competence to pay attention to the linguistic aspect of your document. Therefore, try to present documentation that looks and feels good so that the reviewers can concentrate on what's really important—the factual correctness and completeness of the information.

When it comes, however, to a clash over a choice of words, support your decisions with some solid sources, such as dictionaries ([Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/), [American Heritage](https://ahdictionary.com/), and so on) or other examples of published documents widely considered as exemplary (existing guides, style guides, and the like).

💡 Using Google search results as a source of truth is quite unreliable, as it may be difficult to identify the author and verify their competence. But if you can validate the source and its credibility, then you can use it.
To check the comparative usage frequency of related words or phrases, you can use the [Google Books Ngram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams/).

#### Non-native language

Technical writers are not always native speakers. When you are creating highly standardized information, as is often the case with technical writers, that's not an issue. Provided you keep your texts simple and straightforward, avoid fancy grammar, and observe the conventions of a specific style guide.

💡 Never give up on improving your language skills—in the long run, it gives you an edge over those who neglect doing so.

#### When style guides collide

If your reviewers come from a content creation background, they may be willing to apply their own set of rules and conventions to your text. This may create a collision of style guides that, while based on essentially the same principles, may differ in nuances or preferences (for example, some guides may insist on ending an item in a list with a semicolon, while others prescribe a period there). The result is not exactly a catastrophe, but the text will look slovenly with this clash of different rules in action. The fix is easy: use the same style guide for a series of related documents and clearly indicate that you do so, with the style guide title included, to the reviewer beforehand. 

### Revision checklist

When you feel your content meets the requirements for factual correctness, clarity, and completeness, and all review loops have been completed, run the final checks before publishing your work.

:bulb: Remember the power of breaks. Before you start the review, take a longer break to estrange yourself from your text—preferably, do something totally unrelated to text creation. This will help you get a fresher perspective on your document. When you are in the review phase, space out your work—don't try to run the entire list in one go. Five-minute breaks for each half an hour of review might be in order.

#### Check text

- Run the spellchecker.
- Check text against a list of words that the regular spellchecker may be oblivious of, such as: "it's" vs "its", "out" vs "our", and so on.
- Check for consistent capitalization, spelling (American English), syntax, and punctuation.
- Check for consistent numbering in procedures, tables, and illustrations if required.
- Ensure consistent naming of all titles and subtitles.
- Check that the table of contents contains all relevant titles.
- Check notes, references, and hyperlinks for consistent formatting.
- Check the validity of internal and external references and hyperlinks.
- Avoid term synonyms and ensure terms are defined and consistently used according to the glossary.
- Check the quotation sources, if any.
- Resolve any reviewer comments and remove any revision marks and hidden text.
- Check against the list of abbreviations that they are used properly.

📖 You can also use Vale linter.
[Vale](https://vale.sh/) linter is a command line tool that checks if your text meets the requirements of style guides or your own rules. For those who don't like using command prompt, there's a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ChrisChinchilla.vale-vscode) that acts as a standard spellchecker and shows if your text meets the requirements of style guides.

#### Check tables

- Check for mentions in the text.
- Check for consistent formatting and naming.

#### Check illustrations

- Check for any applied copyright rules, acquiring permission to reproduce the material if necessary.
- Check for potentially unwanted cultural connotations.
- Ensure consistent illustration specifications like formatting, callouts, captions, and mentions in the text.
- Ensure that descriptions align with the overall style of the text.

Creating text isn't solely about writing. It takes time and effort to properly prepare and write a decent document that meets the most stringent standards.

Collect information, filter it relentlessly to leave only what matters to the user, and make every word in your documentation count.

Once your work goes live, you enter a new phase of your life as a technical writer—that of revisiting your document frequently to keep it up to date and useful.

# Visual Aids and Styles

## Introduction

> Design is a plan for arranging elements in such a way as best to accomplish a particular purpose.  
> Charles Eames

### Learning objective

This section compiles best practices for visual aids and styles, drawing on the experiences of your colleagues at EPAM and the broader IT industry. It covers the basics of documentation design, effective use of screenshots, various types of diagrams, and top diagramming tips and tricks.

### Overview

Imagine you're reading a dense technical document with no visual or style elements. An unbroken wall of text looks pretty daunting, right? As technical writers, we possess the ability to simplify complex information. To make it more accessible and captivating, we use not only clear language but also powerful visual aids and design elements.

In an ideal scenario, a technical writer collaborates with a designer who handles visual elements and layout. In reality, however, we often need to add screenshots, draw diagrams, and manage layout and visual styles ourselves. Major technical writing style guides, like those from Apple and Microsoft, typically ignore these topics. Thus, read this chapter for the tips on style and visual aids.

## Key Design Principles

To improve your writing visually, consider that there are just four basic design principles that appear in almost any well-designed document, as outlined by [The Non-Designer's Design Book](https://books.google.by/books?id=gUWPBQAAQBAJ&printsec=copyright&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false).

### Contrast

**Purpose**: To draw attention and create visual interest.
Contrast is often the most important visual attraction on a page—it’s what makes a reader look at the page in the first place.  
**Tip**: Make elements (type, color, size, line thickness, shape, space, and so on) that are not the same drastically different. Strong contrasts attract the eye and make elements stand out.

### Repetition

**Purpose**: To unify and organize the design.
Repeat visual elements of the design throughout the piece. This develops the organization and strengthens the unity.  
**Tip**: Repeat visual elements such as colors, shapes, textures, fonts, and sizes throughout the piece to create cohesion and guide the reader.

### Alignment

**Purpose**: To create a clean, organized look.
Place nothing on the page arbitrarily. Every item should have a visual connection with something else on the page. Find a strong alignment and stick to it.  
**Tips**: Decide on the alignment, placement, and size of images and stick to it to avoid a discordant page layout. Of course, you may need both bigger and smaller images, in which case make sure that you use a limited number of image sizes: for example, only 300x300px for small ones and 1200x800 for full-screen ones (or keep all images on the same width, say 350px for small, 600px for medium, and 1200px for large).  
Place images to the right of the text or below it.  
For large images, consider cropping out or blurring the parts of the user interface (UI) that are not relevant within the context of the provided document.    
Connect elements visually. Align text blocks and graphic elements to create a sophisticated and fresh appearance.

### Proximity

**Purpose**: To organize and clarify information.
Relations between items must be clearly visible.
**Tip**: Group related items close together to reduce clutter and establish clear relationships. Physical closeness implies a connection between elements.

### Common pitfalls to avoid

<table><tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Avoid placing elements in the corners or the middle of the page just to fill space.</td>
    <td>Limit the number of separate elements on a page to avoid clutter.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Clearly connect headlines, subheads, captions, and graphics to their related content.</td>
    <td>Group related elements together; move unrelated entities apart to clarify relationships.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### The design process

To summarize the process of creating the layout:
1. **Identify the focal point**: Decide what you want readers to see first. Use strong contrasts and alignment to highlight this focal point.
2. **Group information**: Organize content into logical groups and display their relationships through proximity.
3. **Maintain strong alignments**: Align text and graphics to create a clean layout. Strengthen edges with alignment.
4. **Repeat, repeat, repeat**: Use repeating elements like bold typefaces, rules, and spatial arrangements to unify the design.
5. **Ensure strong contrast**: Make sure contrast is clear to attract the reader's eye. Remember, contrast helps elements stand out.

## Common visual aids

Now it's time we get down to the most common visual aids used in technical writing:

* Colors
* Screenshots
* GIFs
* Icons
* Diagrams

### Image colors and borders

Color-coding can quickly convey the context or importance of UI elements to readers:
> 🟢 Green for a positive context.  
> 🔴 Red for a negative context.  
> 🔵 Blue or 🟠 orange for a neutral context.

Consider using a single color or a limited palette sparingly across screenshots for consistency. Stick to the corporate colors whenever possible.
> **Note**: Some tools, such as Confluence or Docusaurus, allow customization of their interface colors with a simple CSS code.

Whichever colors you end up using, make sure that:

* The colors contrast well against either light or dark backgrounds.
* Your documentation does not rely on colors only to convey meaning and has the accompanying text.
* Your pages and their visuals remain accessible to people with color blindness. Read more at [Testing for Color Blindness Accessibility](https://accessiblewebsiteservices.com/tools-testing-for-color-blindness-accessibility/).

Borders are a matter of debate, though. The general consensus, however, is that if the app and your help pages both have a white background, add borders to your screenshots to prevent them from blending in. A thin 1px border in black or dark gray (or a shadow effect) can help images stand out. Ensure consistency by using the same border style for all screenshots.

### Screenshots

Screenshots liven up the text and make the information easier to understand.
When the users read about an app with a simple and straightforward UI, screenshots may be redundant. For instance, if a screen has a single search box with a **Search** button, a text description is often sufficient and more space-efficient.

![](img/search-box.png "Bing search box with intuitive UI")

In addition, some UI elements do not need further documentation and therefore do not require screenshots, unless specifically requested.

<table><tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Progress bars</td>
    <td>Confirmation boxes and messages</td>
    <td>Product tours</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Welcome windows</td>
    <td>Message and tooltip texts</td>
    <td>Errors</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Empty states</td>
    <td>Transitional text and loading spinners</td>
    <td>Logout screens</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

However, the times when you can skip adding screenshots are rare. More commonly, you'll need to describe the UI of applications that have complex flows requiring users to navigate multiple UI elements across various windows and views. With your visuals, users can focus on the necessary actions.

In these cases, lengthy descriptions can be quite complicated and even abstract, so screenshots make your instructions easier to understand.  After all, a picture is worth a thousand words.

#### Tools for making screenshots
The choice of a tool for making screenshots is up to you. The following table has some ideas.

<table><thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Tool</th>
    <th>Availability</th>
    <th>User guides</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr></thead>

    <td>Windows only</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mac Tools</td>
    <td>Free</td>
    <td><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-by/guide/mac-help/mh26782/mac">Apple support</a></td>

#### Screenshot annotations

Annotations help draw attention to specific parts of the screenshot, ensuring that users focus on the most important elements.
There are multiple ways you can annotate your screenshots. The following list contains the most common ones:

**Boxes**
* Focus user attention on specific areas.
* Use a contrasting color and sufficient border width.
* Enable [rounded corners](https://uxmovement.com/thinking/why-rounded-corners-are-easier-on-the-eyes).
* Crop to the boxed area if possible.

**Numbers**
* Ideal for procedures requiring sequential steps or UI element enumeration.
* Use numbered screenshots for more than two or three steps; otherwise, text may suffice.

**Callouts and text boxes**
* Use sparingly and with limited text to complement, not replace, the main content.
* Helpful for visual learners in interactive presentations.

**Arrows**
* Illustrate flows, relationships, or sequences of actions.

**Highlights**
* Emphasize specific UI elements by dimming the surrounding areas.

**Blurs**
* Hide irrelevant UI parts, reducing confusion and concealing sensitive information.
* Keep screenshots up-to-date despite UI changes.

To avoid confusing the reader, use annotation types in moderation.

The following illustration intentionally combines multiple annotation types as an example.
![](img/visual-aids.png "A screenshot of a browser window with the most common image annotation types")

#### Captions

Captions add clarity and context to screenshots. Best practices include:
* Keep captions short and relevant.
* Use consistent font size, color, and style.
* Ensure accurate numbering; use variables for automatic numbering if possible (for example, AsciiDoc has the `counter` feature).
* Update captions along with screenshots.
* Position captions below screenshots consistently across documents, in line with APA, MLA, and Chicago style guides. Note that this contrasts the recommendations to add table captions above tables.

*Figure 1. AI-generated image of a fluffy playful black kitten*
<!-- TODO make sure this caption centers well in Learn, because github cannot into image centering -->

#### General screenshot recommendations

* **Usability and accessibility**: Ensure your pages remain useful even if the images fail to load. [Always add alt text to screenshots for accessibility purposes](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/everything-you-need-to-know-to-write-effective-alt-text-df98f884-ca3d-456c-807b-1a1fa82f5dc2). Remember that screenshots are visual aids, not the entire document.  
  > To read more about alt text and its functions, go to [EPAM Technical Competency Center: Image Alt text](https://kb.epam.com/display/ETCCC/Image+Alt+text%3A+what+it+is%2C+why+you+need+it%2C+how+to+write).
* **Default display mode**: When the UI has multiple display modes, use the default display mode (for example, light mode) for screenshots.
* **Information Security**: Blur or crop any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data such as client logos, server names, domains, and network folders.
* **Dummy data**: When capturing screenshots that involve PII, create example users to illustrate interface interactions. See Google's best practices at [Example domains and names](https://developers.google.com/style/examples).
* **Screenshot repository**: Maintain a repository for unannotated screenshots and consider creating a separate folder for icons.
* **Naming convention**: Develop and adhere to a naming convention with versioning support for screenshots, icons, and diagrams.
* **Consistent file format**: Keep screenshots in a consistent format, such as .png or .jpg.
* **Proofreading**: During proofreading, adjust your screen size or zoom in to ensure readability across various devices, particularly on mobile screens. You can do this in every major browser's [Developer Tools](https://devtoolstips.org/tips/en/simulate-devices/). 

### GIFs

Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) images are often used in release notes and for documenting procedures, offering an alternative to static images. As with screenshots, ensure your documentation remains readable and useful if the GIF fails to load.

Keep in mind:
* GIFs are harder to generate and maintain.
* GIF colors are limited to 256, affecting image quality.
* GIFs increase document loading times.
* They still require alt text for accessibility.
* The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) on auto-updating content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#pause-stop-hide) require that users should be able to pause the GIF and that its length cannot exceed five seconds.
* GIFs cannot have flashing lights, as this may trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy.

While MP4 videos and WEBM images can serve as alternatives, they also must comply with the WCAG guidelines.

Given these factors, image galleries, slideshows, or embedded videos might be more effective and accessible alternatives.

### Icons

In your instructions, it's important to specify which UI element the user should interact with. Often, these elements are represented by icons—small symbols that denote specific functions, features, or content types. When writing instructions, pair the icon with the name of the UI element, with the element's name coming first.  
For example, instruct the reader to select **Search** 🔍, or to save the document, select **Save** 💾.

#### Benefits of named UI elements

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Increase accessibility for screen readers.</td>
    <td>Allow LLM-based chatbots to reference UI elements.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Diagrams

Diagrams are symbolic representations of information, using visualization techniques to complement text and enhance understanding. They provide a level of clarity that text alone cannot achieve. Diagrams are used across various domains, including IT, engineering, architecture, and business. Mastering diagramming is especially crucial in fields like electrical engineering, solution architecture, and process design.

![](img/pizza.jpg "AI-generated flowchart for eating pizza with three steps: order, eat, and be happy, with a happy man in blue clothes under each step")

You can read more about the possible diagramming tools at [EPAM Technical Communication Competency Center: Diagrams](https://kb.epam.com/display/ETCCC/Diagrams).

#### Diagram types

There are many types of diagrams that convey various kinds of information and processes. The list below highlights some common types, excluding those less frequently used in technical communication, such as pie charts and bar charts.

**Flowcharts**  
Flowcharts visually represent the sequence of steps and decisions in a process. Each step is noted within a diagram shape, linked by connecting lines and directional arrows, allowing anyone to logically follow the process from beginning to end. In technical documentation, flowcharts are commonly used for planning projects, documenting processes, and visualizing workflows.

**Business Process Modelling Notation (BPMN) diagrams**  
BPMN, designed by the Object Management Group, allows visualization of complex business processes involving many specific actions and activities.  
For more information, visit [www.bpmn.org](https://www.bpmn.org/).

**Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams**  
UML describes software system designs and object interactions in detail. While BPMN focuses on business processes, UML targets software design; the two notations offer complementary views and are compatible.    
To learn more, go to [What is UML](https://www.uml.org/what-is-uml.htm).

**System architecture diagrams**  
Created by system and solution architects, these diagrams visualize how a system or application operates at a high level, ensuring a clear understanding of the system’s structure.   
Learn more at [What is software architecture diagramming](https://miro.com/diagramming/what-is-software-architecture-diagramming/).

**Mind maps**  
Mind maps structure and visualize information as interrelated diagrams, displaying hierarchy and relations between information nodes and clusters. They are ideal for brainstorming.   
To learn more, go to [What is a mind map](https://miro.com/mind-map/what-is-a-mind-map/).

#### Tips for creating diagrams

When you look at a diagram, you can quickly assess its effectiveness. If it appears complicated and confusing, it likely needs improvement.
Effective diagrams convey immediate understanding of their subject matter, highlighting key components, interconnections, and data flow.

While creating a diagram, try to follow some basic tips whenever possible:

* For quick alignment, use the **Grid** view.
* Place the main element in the center and make it stand out.
* Create a symmetrical layout.
* Align elements vertically and horizontally.
* Group related elements accordingly.
* Avoid excessive white space. To optimize white space, use Fit to drawing feature in the Design tab.
* Keep elements neither too close nor too far apart.
* Limit the use of colors. Stick to the corporate or project colors whenever possible.
* Maintain consistency in fonts, sizes, and colors of text and shapes.
* Provide a legend for different connector types and colors.
* Prefer straight connectors and avoid crossings where possible.
* Use uniform types, widths, and colors of connectors.

BRIDGE: The next module explains what happens to documentation after it is published.

# Documentation Life Cycle

## Document Life Cycle

### Introduction

> Incorrect documentation is often worse than no documentation.
>
> Bertrand Meyer

#### Learning objective

The Merriam-Webster entry for life cycle goes as follows: a series of stages through which something (such as an individual, culture, or manufactured product) passes during its lifetime. Let's see how this applies to documentation.

#### Overview

Contrary to popular belief, publishing the document is not the conclusive step—it's only the first step in its life, which can be long, exciting, and full of unexpected turns, or can be so short that people will not even remember that the document ever existed. When you publish a document, you can never tell when it becomes obsolete or irrelevant. Therefore, you need to know what happens to documents after they are published. This understanding may also help with initial planning and eliminate certain pain points from the start.

### Document life cycle

Life cycles are different for various types of documentation. For example, release notes have the shortest lifespan and are never updated after they are published. On the contrary, user guides have a lifespan that lasts as long as the product or software is in active development and support. Therefore, when you create a document, keep in mind how (and if at all) it should be maintained, and when it's even better to pull the plug on it.

See the high-level overview of the document life cycle. This chart excludes creation and archiving, as those are the starting and the ending points of the documentation process (see the Creating Text module).

PICTURE: A diagram illustrating document life cycle

- The *Document published* stage is where the document creators and consumers converge: the technical writers publish the first or the latest reviewed and approved document version.
- The *Update requested* stage is triggered when a new feature is added, for example, by the product owner, or some user feedback. The technical writer carefully studies the changes and decides whether they warrant a mention, a new topic, or the revision of the document.

**Remember**
Updating even a small part of a document may cause a chain reaction of updates in related documents.

- The *Document updated* stage is when the technical writer updates the document as needed, triggering the review process anew.
- The *Document reviewed* stage is covered in Step 6 of the Creating Text module: this is where you or your reviewer make final adjustments. After the revision is complete, the document is republished, continuing the cycle until the document becomes obsolete and is archived or deleted.

### Conclusion

Treating a document as a living thing with a life cycle of its own helps you evolve the document to reflect the current version of the related product or software.

BRIDGE: In the next module, you will learn how to overcome the challenges that you may face when onboarding a new project.

# Onboarding a Project

## Introduction

> By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.
>
> Benjamin Franklin

### Learning objective

Learn the tricks of onboarding a project:

- What information you need to collect.
- How to collect and track information.
- How to retain your sanity throughout a project.

Proper on-boarding reduces the time it takes for a technical writer to become productive and allows them to deliver high-quality output in less time.

### Overview

Instead of leaving everything to chance or your project manager's goodwill and onboarding plan, be prepared yourself to tackle all typical pain points that a technical writer may face when starting on a project.

Obviously, the onboarding process differs from project to project, and many circumstances may play a role. Nevertheless, you can smoothen the process by gathering as much information as possible at the initial stage, for example, during a project interview or introductory meeting.

The onboarding process can be split into two large blocks:

- General aspects that are common for all kinds of specialists.
- Specific aspects that each individual specialist needs to find out themselves. This training covers the points that technical writers need to unveil during onboarding.

## General aspects

General aspects are common for all specialists.

PAGES OPENED FROM LEFT TO RIGHT

### Project purpose

Perhaps, the first three questions you should ask the key project staff are the following:

- What's the purpose of the project?
- What's my role on the project?
- Do I work individually or as part of a team?

Getting the answer to the first question will provide broader context, which is indispensable in understanding where you fit in the grand scheme of things, and will orient you towards the domain knowledge to dive into and a particular skillset to acquire or improve.

The answer to the second question will help you understand what you are expected to do: which information needs to be addressed, who the target audience is, and what types of information need to be developed.

The answer to the third question provides insight into how you will organize your work and distribute duties.

Preparation will definitely save you time, especially if a customer has specific preferences.

### Project methodology and standards

Find out if the project is Agile (which is what most projects claim to be these days) and know the specific methodology followed: Scrum or Kanban.

Context knowledge:

- To learn more about Agile principles, read the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/).
- To learn more about Scrum and Kanban, read the [Scrum](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) and [Kanban](https://kanbanguides.org/english/) guides.

### Project work organization

Find out what you need about environments that you work in: QA, Stage, Production, what environment rules exist, and how you can access each. Find out whether you are supposed to track your tasks in JIRA or other similar tool.

Other possible questions here may include:

- What's the reporting line?
- Is there any revision process?
- What's the release schedule?
- When does each sprint end?

### Team setup

The first Agile principle declares: *"Individuals and interactions over processes and tools".*

People are the most valuable assets on any project. Interactions with the project people will determine if your participation is a success or failure.

Find out the following:

- *Team members, key stakeholders, subject-matter experts (SMEs).*
Is the team fully EPAM or mixed? How many developers, QA engineers, business analysts, and other colleagues are there?
- *Availability of SMEs and preferred channels of communication.*
Where are they physically located? What are their work hours?
- *Escalation routes.*

Whom do you contact if subject-matter experts are unavailable, or when a problem arises?
With answers to these three questions, you'll substantially reduce the impact of the people-related risks on the documentation.

### Project events

Events enable effective cooperation, information sharing, and team-building on the project. It's also your chance to present yourself and the unique skills you bring to the project. Therefore, be part of the events.

If your project follows Scrum, these events would be the Sprint Planning, Dailies, Review, and Retrospective. Make sure you are invited to all meetings. After a while, you'll understand which meetings are crucial and require your presence, and which are optional.

### Project knowledge

Chances are that the project requires passing trainings or a (lengthy) clearance process.

The project knowledge may sit in people's heads rather than in content management systems like Confluence. You may need to find it out and organize knowledge transfer. Otherwise, you might just waste the project time wandering in darkness and hitting the walls or trying to reinvent the wheel.

## Technical writing aspects

### Project setup

Technical writers have to know the following things about a project:

- *Does the project team have any experience working with technical writers?*
It is important to ask that because the project team might have a very vague idea about a technical writer's job description and responsibilities. It's in your best interest to tell them a compelling story of the benefits you will bring to the project.
- *Does the company or project have any style guides?*
If not, then rely on the prominent internationally accepted guides (Microsoft Style Guide, IBM Style Guide, or others).
- *What are the customer requirements?*
The customer defines the project scope and vision. Learn what they think the documentation should look like.
- *What is the documentation scope and vision?*
After you gather and analyze the information, provide your vision of the project documentation, relying on the best technical writing practices.
- *Why will I structure and design the documentation that way?*
If the customer disagrees with your vision, try to be convincing and support your ideas with references to the best standards of technical writing. But remember that ultimately it's the customer who makes the final decision.

### Questions to ask about documentation

Use this checklist to understand what and how you need to create:

- What are the deliverables: user guides, product descriptions, admin guides, tutorials, or how-tos? For multiple types, are priorities known? What timelines exist?
- What are the primary and secondary target audiences: internal users or external users? Are there any persona descriptions available to see who you are expected to target with your documentation? Is it an international audience or some specific audiences (US, UK, Europe, or another locale)? Will you be able to get any feedback on your work from the users?
- What are the delivery preferences? How is a "minimum viable product" document defined?
- What are the primary and additional media: PDFs, MS Word documents, online help, Confluence, or other content management systems?
- Are there any specific standards and tools?
- Does the customer already have a technical writing team or experience of working with technical writers? Are there any existing artifacts that can be used as a model for further documentation? Are there any specific processes in place, such as writing flow (including draft, technical reviewing, linguistic sign-off, and sign-off by the document owner), further revisions, best practices as to keeping the documentation up to date?

### Project tools

Regarding tools used to create project documentation, you can ask the following questions:

- Are the tools used in the project proprietary or open-source? Do I need to complete any specific training before using them?
- Do I need to create any visuals, like diagrams (BPMN, UML), screencasts, and screenshots?
- Should the created documents support customized content (dependent on the target audience or specific variations of the product), and easy propagation of updates and changes across different media? That is: does the customer consider the use of single-source solutions such as MadCap Flare or Help+Manual?
- Can I use [static site generators (SSGs)](https://kb.epam.com/display/ETCCC/Static+Site+Generators) as an alternative or a new documentation solution instead of traditional tools for creating a documentation site (online help)?
- Is any specific knowledge needed: cloud, HTML+CSS, SQL, API, markdown, or Git?

## Practices to get you started and keep you going

- *Keep calm.*
Things will seem complicated at first. That's normal.
- *Introduce yourself to people.*
Practicing and having at hand a short self-presentation talk might be a good idea.
- *Build trust.*
When people trust you, they'll open up more readily, will give you valuable hints, and precious heads-up. And when they see the value you help create, they'll tell other people how awesome technical writers are.
- *Collect all access information.*
Store account details in one clear format, be it a text file, a spreadsheet file, or anything you are used to, and keep it in a secure place, such as an approved password manager.

**Remember**
Never include project-sensitive information, passwords, or real user data in your documentation.

- *Note the dates, deadlines, and people.*
Be an informed team member who knows when things happen, when the deadlines are due, and who is appropriate to contact with project matters.
- *Record the knowledge people share with you.*
Ask for permission to do so, and explain why you might need to do that: a simple reason for valuing someone's time might be good enough.
- *Create realistic expectations.*
Give a promise only when you are sure to keep it. When people ask you to churn out a 50-page guide in a week, explain what it takes to create effective documentation.
- *Ask questions of any kind: naive, simple, smart.*
Your job is to gain all the information you can and translate it into actionable and trustworthy documentation.

## Conclusion

PICTURE

To successfully onboard a project, you need to:

- Know as much about a project and documentation tasks as you can.
- Keep your knowledge up to date and readily available to you.
- Know your team and communicate with them.

BRIDGE: In the next chapter, you will learn how modern generative AI impacts technical communication and what you can do about it.

# Advent of AI

## Generative AI: to be or not to be

> Wir funktionieren Automatik, jetzt wollen wir tanzen Mechanik.
>
> Kraftwerk, "Die Roboter"

### Technical Communication and Generative AI

Recent years have brought about new content creation technologies aimed to revolutionize all creative work as we know it. New terms, such as Generative AI, Large Language Models, or Machine Learning, previously confined to the research and development domain, have spread beyond IT. And the introduction of ChatGPT, neural networks, and other automatic content-generating tools to the public, steamrolled the professional communities and put forward a reasonable question: What do we do next?

In technical communication, generative AI (or GenAI) may seem as a substitute for the entire profession, considering that:

- AI can process large amounts of data&mdash;a feat unachievable by people.
- It generates content in real time, in a matter of seconds.
- GenAI can be "trained" to follow particular styles and standards, and use templates.
- It searches and compiles, processing various pieces of information and bringing them together to form new content.

Sounds great, right? No need to read manuals, scrape through various webpages to find a specific answer, and no need to contact support&mdash;the smart machine provides all the answers. But does it?

### The pitfalls of AI

Although providing great capabilities, generative AI has substantial, and even critical flaws. Just to name a few:

- It relies solely on the training and source data, therefore, if the data is of bad or mediocre quality, or fundamentally inaccurate, the AI won't identify the flaws&mdash;it will continue generating content, reproducing and multiplying the errors.
- AI does not check the facts—it only uses algorithms to generate content based on user prompts. As a result, generated information requires a thorough review before it can be published or used it to create more content.
- The quality of the provided information is heavily dependent on the prompt quality. Moreover, the AI normally generates different information based on the same prompt. Users can't see the underlying algorithms that make a particular AI tick.
- Modern GenAI tools tend to "hallucinate", that is invent information that may meet the prompt requirements, but is factually incorrect or not working, like AI-generated code samples. For details, see [AI hallucination](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/AI-hallucination).

Nevertheless, employing GenAI in technical communication can be useful and efficient if approched carefully and reasonably. If you decide to use any GenAI tool in your work, keep in mind that any such tool is only as good as its source data and always carefully review the content generated by AI. Obviously, revision requires solid skills in technical communication to spot obscure and vague mistakes and inconsistencies, so AI tools are actually nudging specialists to develop and grow professionally.

### Practical usage of AI

As was mentioned in the previous section, AI is trained on terabytes of data "fed" by the AI developers. As you don't (and cannot) know much about the quality of the training data, it's advisable to question any AI-generated content until your carefully review it based your own knowledge and experience.

So what are the actual ways to use GenAI in technical communication? See a few examples:

- Generating draft presentations with predefined corporate style, color palette, and other relevant design features.
- Creating a skeleton structure for various documentation, including user guides, knowledge bases, reference manuals, and so on.
- Suggesting ideas for marketing materials, especially if you are facing a writer's block, or are pressed for time.
- Designing visuals to complement the documentation.
- Proposing designs for landing pages and overall documentation.
- Reviewing the language, either simplifying or enriching it.

Of course, these are only a few examples, and you can expand the implementation capabilities of GenAI to meet your needs. However to use AI for more complex tasks, you need to learn how to create complex prompts. Prompts are requests that state what you need the AI to generate: the more detailed and specific the prompt is, the more accurately the AI-generated content meets your expectation.

To learn more about using AI in technical communication, we recommend completing the [AI-Assisted Technical Communication](https://learn.epam.com/detailsPage?id=fed0078e-4c12-45b2-b3dc-54dbe01b0b32) training course.

GenAI in technical communication, as well as in other fields, can save time on performing monotonous repetitive tasks, and provide more opportunities to engage in higher-level activities, such as planning, developing content strategies, devising approaches to improve corporate standards, educating and managing colleagues, and so on.

## Conclusion

PICTURE.

As with all new tools that seem revolutionary, GenAI already has a tremendous impact on content creation and development. And, as with all revolutionary tools in the past, it doesn't substitute human labor$mdash;it only reshapes it, introducing new methods of performing your job duties. Therefore, it's our responsibility to tame the tool to serve our purposes, not the other way around.
